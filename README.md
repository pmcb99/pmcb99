# **Paul McBrien** 👋  
I'm Paul McBrien, a software engineer from Ireland, having worked in Silicon Valley and with the Viturbi Startup Garage incubator in Los Angeles in the past.

## **About Me**
- **Name**: Paul McBrien  
- **Languages**: TypeScript/NodeJS, Python are my main backend languages - React for frontend

## **What I Do**
- 🌍 **Software Engineer Team Lead**, Dublin  
- 💣 Previously worked at startups and **Listful.AI Software Co**, and **NSAI**  
- 🎓 MSc in Computer Science (AI) and BSc in Applied Physics, both from Dublin City University
- 🧠 Passionate about distributed systems, automation, and AI security applicatons
- 📝 Dedicated to delivering high-performance, secure, and scalable solutions across projects  

## **My Interests**
- ❤️ Exploring distributed systems, automation, and cryptography, and AI
- ✨ Enthusiastic about Typescript, NodeJS, Python and databases
- 🌍 Writing and contributing to academic research and open-source projects (such as Odmantic and SQLModel)
- 📘 Researching ways to optimize network management systems and AI pipelines
- 🔗 Currently interested in disaster-resistant technologies - currently implementing **Kademlia** for distributed hash tables

## **Some Of My Work (Research)**
- 📄 **GSAFE**: A novel framework in video using interpretable and privacy-preserving feature extraction. Key security contributions:  
  - Resilience to detection evasion attacks such as image transformations.
  - Enhanced privacy with minimal feature leakage (e.g., 32-bit embeddings).  
  - Computational efficiency, outperforming traditional methods by 74% in feature extraction speed.  
- 📄 **AI**: Finetuning small LLMs for secure, ultra fast local processing
